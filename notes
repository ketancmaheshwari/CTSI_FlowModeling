==Objectives

Biological:
1) Determine if particular lymphoid tissues have distinctive subsets of B cells; agglomerative clustering.
2) Establish the interrelationships between cells of different lymphoid tissues; relationship modeling.
3) Compare the B cell composition of lymphoid versus non-lymphoid tissue; agglomerative clustering followed by relationship modeling
4) Identify novel phenotypic populations; agglomerative clustering with retention of single cell information.

Timeline: (n=5 donors, 6 month goal; n=30 donors 1 year goal)

Computational:
1) Implement HPC batch processing of flow cytometry data (6 month goal).
2) Investigate tSNE parallelization. Proof of concept (6 month goal). Implementation, if feasible (1 year goal).
3) Investigate end-to-end data pipeline in which data collected at the flow cytometer can be automatically sent to HPC servers (establish community interest and potential barriers, 6 month goal)



-- Make the pipeline available to the university flow cytometry community

-- Possibility of using python for the work--identify potential packages, libraries

-- Parallelization: algorithms and data

-- Translational aspects

-- End to end pipeline: from instruments to HPC

-- Possible publications: 
 1) A domain science publication--results and methods,
 2) A computer science publication--parallelization and HPC,
 3) Negative/Null results--if applicable
